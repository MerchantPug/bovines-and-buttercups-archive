## Language Changes
- Added Simplified Chinese language support ([#24](https://github.com/MerchantPug/bovines-and-buttercups/pull/24) - Nuttar2004).

## Dependencies
- Updated Mixin Extras to 0.3.6

All of the below was backported from the upcoming 2.0.0 update. Enjoy.

## Minor Changes
- Swapped Buttercup and Pink Daisy Moobloom Ranch structures to have their respective Mooblooms instead of the opposite one.
  - This was done for slightly more cohesion with these structures. 
  - You can still figure out that the breeding blocks are a thing, just look for the particles.

## Bugfixes
- Fixed data driven cow types always selecting the first type upon being struck by lightning when it should be randomised.
- Fixed an escape path within the Buttercup Ranch.
- Fixed Limelight Ranches only not being found by /locate and similar when they generate in water.
