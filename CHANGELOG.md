### Changes
- By default, Bowls of Nectar now use a custom texture defined by a new field `"nectar_texture"` inside a Moobloom Confiured Cow Type JSON file. The old behavior can still be applied by removing this new field.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed model transforms being unmodifiable by override models. #2
- Fixed backwards compatibility with existing mooshrooms in the world.
